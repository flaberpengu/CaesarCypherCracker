# CaesarCypherCracker
Originally developed around 30th August 2019.\
A programme that takes an encrypted message within a text file and decrypts it. Only cracks caesar cypher currently.\
It also checks against a wordlist for valid English words and only outputs decrypted messages which have a decent amount of matches.\
Future plans: add other encryption techniques.
